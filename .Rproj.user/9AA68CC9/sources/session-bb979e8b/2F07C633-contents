# Fulmore River Sockeye Salmon Smolt Enumeration

## Project Background

This is a live document intended to share information about juvenile salmon captured in the Fulmore River by rotary screw trap. The Fulmore River is located in the traditional territory of the Tlowitsis First Nation, at the head of Port Neville, approximately 80 NE of Campbell River. The trap was installed on April 11-12 and will fish roughly 5-days a week (Monday to Friday) until June 15, 2024. All fish captured in the trap will be identified to species and measured for fork length. Biological samples will be collected from a subset of fish each day, including weight, scales and DNA samples.

## Captures to Date

Since April 15, the trap has fished for a total of `r (length(unique(catch_dat$Date)))` days, resulting in the capture of Sockeye Salmon, Coho Salmon, Chum Salmon, Coastal Cutthroat Trout, Dolly Varden Char, Pacific Lamprey and Sculpin (Cottidae spp.)

### Sockeye Salmon

The length-frequency distribution for Sockeye Salmon smolts is bimodal, indicating that two groups of fish of consistently different size are emigrating. Scale aging will be required to assess what is contributing to this observed difference. However, it is likely be explained by: 

  1) Differences in age class between modes (e.g., Age-1 and Age-2 smolts), or; 

  2) Differences in rearing environments (e.g., if smolts are the same age, but some are rearing in streams and some are rearing in the lake), or;
