# Intro

Simms Creek is a small, 3rd order stream that drains an area of \~1,800 ha into the Salish Sea, near Campbell River's Willow Point neighborhood. The lower reach of Simms Creek (\~3 km of channel, east of Jubilee Road), is contained within a narrow urban green way that is bordered by residential properties. From Jubilee Road to the Inland Highway the stream is protected within [Beaver Lodge Lands](https://campbellriver.travel/news/forestry-guide-to-beaver-lodge-lands/), upstream of the Inland Highway, \>1.5 km of tributary channel is located within private forest lands.

Historic fish observations indicate that Chum, Chinook, Pink and Coho Salmon have all been observed in the stream, as well as Coastal Cutthroat Trout, Rainbow Trout and Steelhead. Recent records, this dataset, suggest that Coho Salmon and Coastal Cutthroat Trout are the primary species within Simms Creek, both of which utilize the stream year round - though a small number of juvenile Chinook Salmon were identified in 2024.

[Greenways Land Trust](https://www.greenwaystrust.ca/) has supported Simms Creek Stewards for +20 years, including operation of a fish fence near the mouth of the stream since 2008. Juvenile and adult fish moving past the fence are tallied each spring and fall, respectively. The objective of this project is to explore the juvenile fence dataset. All work is being done strictly for fun and out of personal curiosity. Any feedback, input, or support is welcome. Also, I have a soft spot for Coastal Cutthroat Trout (CCT), so be warned that all analysis will be trout heavy.

# Overview of Fence Monitoring Effort
The Simms Creek fish fence has operated annually since 2008, with the exception of 2020-21 when operations were paused due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and in the spring of 2023 when federal employees were on strike. 

### Spring Monitoring Effort

Spring surveys target out migrating juvenile Coho Salmon but also capture an impressive number of Coastal Cutthroat Trout and have even captured some Chinook Salmon. Spring fence monitoring has started as early as `r format(min(trap_plot$date.std[trap_plot$Period=="Spring"]), "%B %d")`, however, most surveys (50%) don't start until `r format(min(trap_plot$date.std[trap_plot$Period=="Spring" & trap_plot$prop.sampled >= 0.5]), "%B %d")`. In each monitoring year, the fence has operated  continuously (e.g., sampling occurred at least daily) from `r format(min(trap_plot$date.std[trap_plot$Period=="Spring" & trap_plot$prop.sampled == 1.0]), "%B %d")` to `r format(max(trap_plot$date.std[trap_plot$Period=="Spring" & trap_plot$prop.sampled == 1.0]), "%B %d")`. Surveys have continued as late as `r format(max(trap_plot$date.std[trap_plot$Period=="Spring"]), "%B %d")`, but most (50%) are terminated by `r format(max(trap_plot$date.std[trap_plot$Period=="Spring" & trap_plot$prop.sampled==0.5]), "%B %d")`.

### Fall Monitoring Effort

Fall surveys to count the number returning adult Coho, Chinook, Chum and Pink Salmon and also intercept a small number of Cutthroat Trout. In the fall, surveys have started as early as `r format(min(trap_plot$date.std[trap_plot$Period=="Fall"]), "%B %d")`, however, most surveys (50%) have started on `r format(min(trap_plot$date.std[trap_plot$Period=="Fall" & trap_plot$prop.sampled >= 0.5]), "%B %d")`. In each monitoring year, surveys have occurred continuously (e.g., sampling occurred daily) from `r format(min(trap_plot$date.std[trap_plot$Period=="Fall" & trap_plot$prop.sampled == 1.0]), "%B %d")` to `r format(max(trap_plot$date.std[trap_plot$Period=="Fall" & trap_plot$prop.sampled == 1.0]), "%B %d")`. Surveys have continued as late as `r format(max(trap_plot$date.std[trap_plot$Period =="Fall"]), "%B %d")` and no surveys have occurred later than `r format(max(trap_plot$date.std[trap_plot$Period=="Fall" & trap_plot$prop.sampled >= 0.5]), "%B %d")`.

There is considerable interannual variability in the timing of downstream migrations. For Coastal cutthroat trout, the date that 50% of total out migrants passed the fence ranged from `r format(min(pass.date$minPass.std[pass.date$Species=="CCT"]), "%b-%d")` to `r format(max(pass.date$minPass.std[pass.date$Species=="CCT"]), "%b-%d")`(mean = `r format(mean(pass.date$mean.min[pass.date$Species=="CCT"]), "%b-%d")`). In contrast, the date that 50% of total out migrating Coho Salmon passed the fence ranged from `r format(min(pass.date$minPass.std[pass.date$Species=="CO"]), "%b-%d")` to `r format(max(pass.date$minPass.std[pass.date$Species=="CO"]), "%b-%d")`(mean = `r format(mean(pass.date$mean.min[pass.date$Species=="CO"]), "%b-%d")`)

Fence monitoring starts in April and continues through late May to mid June. The first day of trap operation has ranged from `r format(min(as.Date(trap_ops$Start, "%b-%d")),"%b-%d")` to `r format(max(as.Date(trap_ops$Start, "%b-%d")), "%b-%d")` (mean = `r format(mean(as.Date(trap_ops$Start, "%b-%d")),"%b-%d")`). Once monitoring was initiated the traps were checked nearly continuously, with an average of `r round(mean(trap_ops$prop.sample.period),1)` of days being monitored. After a mean of `r round(mean(trap_ops$DaysSampled),0)` days the trap was dismantled and monitoring was ceased between `r format(min(as.Date(trap_ops$End, "%b-%d")),"%b-%d")` and `r format(max(as.Date(trap_ops$End, "%b-%d")),"%b-%d")` (mean = `r format(mean(as.Date(trap_ops$End, "%b-%d")),"%b-%d")`).

Annual trap operation periods and total captures of Coastal Cutthroat Trout and Coho Salmon are presented below in Table 1.

## Coastal Cutthroat Trout

As previously mentioned, I like CCT, so let's start there. We will look at the size of fish being captured, when the majority of the fish are migrating, and start to consider what may be driving some of the variability in migrants between years.
